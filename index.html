            <h1>Classic Pork Pörkölt</h1>
            <p>Pork pörkölt (pronounce: ˈpørkølt) is a traditional Hungarian pork stew made by slow-cooking pork pieces
                with onions, paprika, and other spices. It has a rich, flavorful sauce and is typically served with
                dumplings (nokedli), boiled potatoes, or bread. The dish is a staple of Hungarian cuisine and is similar
                to goulash but thicker, not necessarily made of beef (often pork or even chicken is used) and without
                potatoes in the stew itself.</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about
                    10 minutes. Drain, and reserve the drippings. Add the onions to the bacon and cook together until
                    the onion is translucent. Remove skillet from heat and stir the paprika, garlic powder, and pepper
                    into the bacon mixture. Transfer the mixture into a large stockpot.</li>
                <li>Heat a small amount of the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet again over medium-high heat. Cook
                    the pork chops in batches in the hot drippings until evenly browned on both sides. Use additional
                    bacon drippings for each batch as needed. Remove the pork chops to a cutting board and blot excess
                    fat off the surface of the chops with a paper towel; cut into bite-sized cubes and stir into the
                    bacon mixture.</li>
                <li>Heat a small amount of the bacon drippings in the skillet; cook and stir the bell pepper in the hot
                    drippings until softened and fragrant; drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Stir the cooked
                    pepper into the bacon mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour the tomatoes with liquid and beef broth into a stockpot and place the pot over medium-high
                    heat. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until the stew begins to thicken,
                    stirring occasionally, about 90 minutes. Stir the sour cream into the stew just before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve with galuska (Hungarian dumplings), noodles, boiled potatoes or rice.</li>
